# ModMenuGTA5-1.44
My old mod menu updated to online version 1.44
Undetected to use online, and all detected features has been removed/commented out.
Used it for a few months, so shouldn't by a problem. Change some code by adding, removing features and so on just to be safe.
## How to use?
- Download this and compile it by using Visual Studio (or another compiler)
- Inject the .dll into the GTA5.exe process with an dll injector
- Have fun :)
